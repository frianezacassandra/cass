<h2>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.</h2>
<p>
	STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and refers to any subjects that fall under these four disciplines. Because these things are never straightforward, there are also dozens of alternative versions of STEM (including STEAM, STREAM and METALS) but STEM is by far the most widely-used.
    <br><br>
    The acronym originates from discussions about the lack of qualified graduates to work in high-tech jobs in the US. Since its creation, governments and universities around the world have made attracting students to STEM courses a priority, in order to address this shortfall. In some cases, itâ€™s also easier to immigrate to another country if you studied a STEM subject at degree level and are looking for work in that field.
